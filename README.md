Description
My portfolio demonstrates my work as a full-stack developer with links to the deployed applications, links to my github, as well as a bio, contact information, and link to my LinkedIn. 

In order to create my portfoio, I updated a previous mock portfolio project and showcased 1 project and 2 past homework assignments. I updated my previous bio and added links to my github, resume, and LinkedIn profiles in the navigation.
